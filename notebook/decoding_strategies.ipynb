    "# Demonstrating Different Decoding Strategies with Hugging Face Transformers\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore various decoding strategies for text generation using a small encoder-decoder model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. We'll apply these strategies to two different datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Translation task where deterministic strategies are expected to perform better.\n",
    "- Summarization task where stochastic strategies might yield more diverse and informative outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoding strategies we'll test include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Greedy Search\n",
    "2. Beam Search\n",
    "3. Temperature Sampling\n",
    "4. Top-k Sampling\n",
    "5. Top-p (Nucleus) Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll define a custom ```generate_text``` function to apply these strategies and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics for each dataset.\n",

    "The BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score is a metric for evaluating the quality of text that has been machine-translated from one language to another. It compares a candidate translation to one or more reference translations and calculates a score based on the overlap of n-grams (contiguous sequences of words).\n",

    "BLEU-4: Considers up to 4-gram matches between the candidate and reference translations. It provides a balance between precision (matching words) and fluency (maintaining the structure of the language). Using BLEU-4 allows us to capture not just individual word matches (unigrams) but also phrases of up to four words. This makes the evaluation more sensitive to the quality of the translation in terms of both accuracy and fluency.\n",
